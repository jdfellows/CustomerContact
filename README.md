# CustomerContact

Create a Person class as a blueprint for a Person object and a Contact class as a blueprint for a Contact object.

Create a GUI Application to receive the input that will allow you to build a new Contact object, populate all of its fields (including those inherited by the Person class), and output the Customer Contact information to the Console. The class file created for this GUI Application should be named CustomerContact and should contain a main method that provides all of the functionality for the application.
